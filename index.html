                    <span class="code-comment">
                        My history with programming began when I was 15 years old. 
                        My first program was a simple password generator written in C++.
                        It is true that I used the Internet a lot at that time, 
                        but the experience gained during this project encouraged me to
                        further develop in this field. What I remember most from that period is a simple troll 
                        virus that I wrote to upload later for my Russian language teacher.
                        A friend sent a text message impersonating a supplier to move
                        the car because he can't enter. 
                        When the lady left the room, I installed this virus for her.
                        It was a lot of fun when the whole computer started going crazy for her during class. 
                        The mouse was bouncing around the screen and the computer was making
                        various beeping sounds and the keyboard was locked. Later on, I decided to learn math, 
                        played around with arduino and Unreal Engine a bit, and became interested in AI and hacking. 
                        Besides, I like various physical activities, mainly a gym, but electronics
                        and computer science are the only things in which I like to develop so much.
